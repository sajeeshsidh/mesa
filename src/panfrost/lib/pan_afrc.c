/* Arm Fixed-Rate Compression (AFRC) is a lossy compression scheme natively
 * implemented in Mali GPUs. AFRC images can only be rendered or textured
 * from. It is currently not possible to do image reads or writes to such
 * resources.
 *
 * AFRC divides the image into an array of fixed-size coding units which are
 * grouped into paging tiles. The size of the coding units (clump size)
 * depends on the image format and the pixel layout (whether it is optimized
 * for 2D locality and rotation, or for scan line order access). The last
 * parameter is the size of the compressed block that can be either 16, 24,
 * or 32 bytes.
 *
 * The compression rate can be calculated by dividing the compressed block
 * size by the uncompressed block size (clump size multiplied by the component
 * size and the number of components).
